# COMP-49X-24-25-TransactCampus

Dashboard to view campus student dining data and trends.

To run: Run pip install requirements.txt to import necessary modules. Then run Flask application, and sign into PowerBI account when page is open.

Sprint 1: Implements PowerBI dashboard to view data summary for dummy breakfast data. Right now, you must sign into a valid PowerBi account so the report isn't public to everyone, and only viewable by users in the Workspace. In an upcoming sprint we will implement a login screen, so a PowerBI account isn't necessary. 

Sprint 2: Updated PowerBI dashboard to view data summary for dummy lunch data, and home page to view data for all times. Since we now have multiple reports, we added buttons to be able to navigate between reports. We also updated the PowerBI report to connect to a PostgreSQL database. Finally, we added a Docker Container so that our app now runs in a Local Containerized Instance.
