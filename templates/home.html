            <p>
                This dashboard helps track and analyze student dining behavior across campus using Transact data.
                The tools below offer insight into health grouping trends, meal quality, and behavioral patterns using
                interactive Power BI reports. The goal of this application is to allow campus administrators to gain the analysis 
                needed based on student dining habits and visualized data metrics to analyze their campus dining information. Each tool
                sets to help a administrator identify the eating habits, rate, and possible incentives that can overall allow them to put
                in place decisions that help improve student well being and overall eating habits of campus dining.
